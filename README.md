# Not Whatsapp Web

*This is not Whatsapp Web, although it looks like it.*

This is a school project, a real time chat, done in Node.js with Socket.io and React.js, using MaterializeCSS for layout and styles.

It is in a very early alpha stage, so it may have some bugs and usability issues that will be taken in account.
